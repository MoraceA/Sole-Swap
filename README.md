# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



<h2><B> Step 1 </h2> </b>
Type in your VSC terminal cd <your file path> for your project. For example, my file path is in /Users/sole-swap, so I would type in cd /Users/sole-swap. If this doesn't work, just type in cd sole-swap. `

<h2><B> Step 2 </h2> </b>
Once you're in the correct file directory, type npm install. If you are in the correct directory, then it should work. If it is erroring, you're not in the correct directory. You must type in npm install in order to install the node modules for the vite + react project to run on your computer.

<h2><B> Step 3 </h2> </b>
Once the node modules are installed, type npm run dev to run the project. Your terminal should guide you with the keys to open the project. Type o & return to open the project in your server.
